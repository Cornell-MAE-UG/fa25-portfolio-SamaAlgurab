As the second speaker in the video, I explained the main concept behind the salon chair: the hydraulic jack. I described its key components (the lever arm, pump, piston, ram, and hydraulic fluid) and how a small force on the pedal creates pressure that gets amplified to lift the chair.

I also went over the engineering assumptions we made, like treating the fluid as incompressible and assuming static conditions so we could use simple fluid mechanics models. Finally, I introduced the hydrostatic equation to show how we approximated the pressure inside the cylinder.

My role was to connect the real mechanism of the chair to the fluid-mechanics theory and set up the foundation for the analysis the rest of my group presented.
